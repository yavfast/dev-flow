# Experience Capture — Reflection & Salience at Transitions

Cross-cutting sub-procedure for every phase. Like [Delegation for Focus](delegation.md), it is **not** a pipeline stage — it runs *inside* whatever phase is executing, firing at the boundaries between stretches of work. Where delegation protects *attention* by moving noise out of the context, Experience Capture protects *memory*: it distills what a stretch of work produced — the decision, the lesson, the one line worth keeping — **before** the raw turns that produced it are compacted away.

## Why this exists

Compaction is where context is lost, and dev-flow archives by **age** — the oldest turns go first, whether or not they still matter. A long session pays for this twice: the raw back-and-forth of solving something is bulky and mostly noise once solved, yet the *lesson* inside it is exactly what you want to survive. Left alone, the summary keeps the noise and drops the signal.

Two design commitments shape the cure, both learned the hard way (and confirmed by prior art — Generative Agents, Reflexion, Voyager, MemGPT, MemoryBank):

- **Store the distillation, not the transcript.** What survives is a short summary plus any durable lesson — never the raw turns, which are referenced by path if kept at all.
- **Trust structure, not self-assessment.** An agent's numeric self-rating ("importance 8/10", "confidence 90%") is unreliable. So reflection fires on **deterministic structural events** dev-flow already logs, and salience is recorded with the **discrete markers** of [Salience Markers](../phases/status.md#salience-markers) — never a self-scored number.

The north star behind all of it: keep durable task state **complete in L2** (`.dev_flow/`) so the transcript becomes disposable and a fresh session can restart from files deterministically — which beats riding a lossy context-summary (see the [memory tiers](cache.md#memory--data-tiers-l0l1l2)).

## The unit: a segment

A **segment** is a coherent stretch of work on one topic or task, bounded by two transitions — e.g. "spec-SP_SAL" from opening the spec to finishing it. It has a short label, an owning task, and a lifecycle of exactly `open → closed` (closed once, by the transition that ends it). The label is what a response's trailer names; the checkpoint at its closing boundary is what distills it.

## Transition Checkpoint — the primary cadence

At a transition, run a **checkpoint** over the segment that is closing. This formalizes behavior good agents already do ad hoc; the value is doing it *reliably, at known boundaries*.

**Detecting a transition.** Anchor on **structural** signals — `phase-boundary`, `task-switch`, `subtask-done` — which are deterministic events dev-flow already records. **Semantic** signals (a visible topic-shift, an explicit marker you raise) are a best-effort secondary: useful for an intra-phase checkpoint, but **never the sole basis when a structural signal is also available**, and self-detected topic boundaries alone are never a valid trigger (that is the self-assessment trap again).

**What a checkpoint does**, in order:

1. **Distill** the closing segment — a noisy read, so delegate it (see [Delegation for Focus](delegation.md)) and keep only the conclusion.
2. **Record a segment summary** as a Shared Activity Log entry tagged `{s:pin}` — a few lines of "what happened / what was decided", referencing any raw material by path, never inlining it (the no-large-blobs rule).
3. **Demote the raw turns** of the segment — re-grade them `{s:noise}`, or `{s:superseded→<summary>}` when the summary replaces them.
4. **Apply durable lessons** (next section) — auto-written through structural gates; a doubtful write goes to independent review first.
5. **Close the segment**, and **promote** the durable part of working memory to L2 (see [Relation to working memory](#relation-to-working-memory)).

The pinned summary now survives a dev-flow compaction while the raw turns are evicted first — the signal kept, the noise shed.

## Harvest before demote (ordering invariant)

When a task **closes**, `DemoteOnTaskClose` makes its salience markers inert (a `pin` is task-scoped — see [Salience Markers](../phases/status.md#salience-markers)), re-grading the segment's still-pinned raw turns to effective `normal` and so making them eviction-eligible. The checkpoint that harvests the closing task's lesson MUST run **before** that demotion — reflect first, demote second — so reflection reads the segment's full, still-retained material before it can be evicted (and so the new summary's `pin` is recorded while the task is still active). The harvested lesson itself does not depend on the `pin` — it is routed out to a proposal — but the reflection that produces it must run while its source is still protected. (This task-close *demote* — inerting all the task's markers — is distinct from the intra-checkpoint *demote* in step 3, which re-grades the segment's raw turns to `noise`.)

## Applying experience — auto-apply through structural gates

Self-learning is a **standing, ungated process**: a harvested lesson is written to the owning catalogue **automatically, with no permission prompt** ([C_EXC_DEC_06](../docs/experience_capture.concept.md#C_EXC_DEC_06)). The gate is **structural, never a self-score**:

- A **reusable constraint or convention** → write a [rule](../phases/rule.md). Auto-written rules default to **`should`**; a `prefer` is fine. **Never auto-write a `must`** — a `must` blocks future code, so it is treated as doubtful (below).
- **Broadly-useful, non-trivial** project knowledge that passes the [skill](../phases/skill.md) non-triviality filter → write/update a skill. (Write the content as a falsifiable, evidence-scoped observation — never an absolute verdict.)
- Anything narrow, trivial, or one-off → drop it.

**Doubtful → independent review (not suppression).** When a write is doubtful — a would-be `must`-severity rule, a **contradiction** with an existing rule/skill, or a **deletion** — do not skip it and do not write it blindly: route it to an **independent clean-context review** ([Delegation for Focus](delegation.md)). It lands only if the reviewer confirms. "Doubtful" is defined by these structural triggers, not by a self-rated confidence.

**The developer's review moves to commit time, it does not disappear.** Every auto-write lands in the working tree and is surfaced in the diff under the standing commit-approval gate ([SKILL.md → Commit rules](../SKILL.md#git-workflow-integration)); mention auto-written rules/skills in the commit message and the Response Trailer so they are visible, never silent. Nothing here touches the commit gate.

This is the single home for reflection in dev-flow: [audit](../phases/audit.md) Step 3 "reflect", implement/fix **rule auto-discovery**, and [research](../phases/research.md) Step 4 persistence are all **invocations of this procedure**, not parallel paths.

## The Response Trailer — response-granularity carrier

Between checkpoints, an individual response can still carry salience and signal a pending transition with a compact **trailer** — a single labelled line, factual fields only:

```
⟦checkpoint⟧ segment · type · decisions · artifacts · {s:…} · transition?
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `segment` | The segment label this response belongs to |
| `type` | `decision` / `exploration` / `refinement` / `status` |
| `decisions` | DEC ids settled or opened (if any) |
| `artifacts` | Files touched (if any) |
| salience | the entry's `{s:…}` value (`pin` / `normal` / `noise`) |
| `transition?` | does this response close a segment (fire a checkpoint)? |

**Factual fields only.** A subjective numeric self-score — confidence %, quality N/10 — is **not permitted**; it is the unreliable signal the whole design avoids. The durable copy is the **task-file entry**; a *visible* footer is optional and reserved for semantically complex responses (it need not appear on every turn).

**Pre-action sibling.** The same fact-only, pointer-only idiom runs *forward* as well as back: [Application Enforcement](application-enforcement.md)'s **Pre-Action Marker** re-surfaces the applicable rules/skills (+ their freshness) *before* an action burst, where this trailer reports *after* one. Same format, opposite direction — one machinery, no new format.

## Context pressure — a tiered, proxy-driven trigger

A checkpoint can also fire because the context is filling up — but assessed by **proxy, never by introspection, and never by riding the harness's own compaction**:

- **Signal** — `window_fill` if (and only if) the runtime exposes it; otherwise derive pressure from **structural proxies**: turn count, task-file size, repetition signals, error rate. The trigger is portable across runtimes precisely because it does not depend on a fill number the runtime may hide.
- **Tiers** — the *pressure level* (left) names the input severity; [`AssessContextPressure`](../docs/experience_capture.sp.md#SP_EXC_02_06) returns the matching *response action* (in parentheses):
  - **ok** — nothing to do. *(action: `ok`)*
  - **moderate** — run a checkpoint now (distill + pin the summary, demote raw), stay lean. *(action: `checkpoint`)*
  - **high + degradation** — ensure the task files are fully checkpointed and **always-resumable**, then **recommend a graceful session handoff** to the developer: a deterministic restart-from-files via the [status phase](../phases/status.md), not a lossy auto-compact. *(action: `recommend-handoff`)*

**Honest boundary.** The agent cannot prevent a harness auto-compact, nor reliably read the window fill. So `recommend-handoff` is exactly that — a recommendation to the developer, backed by the standing duty to keep task files always-resumable — not an action the agent can force. It must **never** trigger an automatic compaction, and must never decide the tier from self-assessment.

## Relation to working memory

Experience Capture is what fires the L1→L2 movements of [session working memory](cache.md#session-working-memory-l1):

- **At a checkpoint** — *promote to durable*: a settled decision, a confirmed parameter, a harvested lesson moves into `.dev_flow/`; the rest stays L1 scratch.
- **After a compaction / on a subtask switch** — *re-attention*: re-read the working-memory area to rebuild focus before continuing (the [status read protocol](../phases/status.md#read-protocol) opens with this).

## Where it runs (touchpoints)

| Phase / moment | How Experience Capture applies |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| implement / fix / verify | Checkpoint at phase and subtask boundaries; trailer on complex responses; context-pressure assessed as the session grows |
| [audit](../phases/audit.md) Step 3 (reflect) | The reflect step **is** a checkpoint invocation — harvest lessons from a closing task and auto-apply them as rules/skills through the structural gate |
| [research](../phases/research.md) Step 4 | Persisting durable spike findings is the same harvest-and-auto-apply move |
| Specialist end-of-burst | A project specialist accrues role-local heuristics **per call** (it self-writes its own memory, so the next call warm-starts on them); this per-call append is **ungated** (only the skill promotion below passes a gate), so — applying "trust structure, not self-assessment" to memory *content* — each heuristic is written as a *falsifiable, evidence-scoped observation*, never an absolute verdict (an over-stated one poisons later warm-starts). At **end-of-burst** this procedure harvests the burst's heuristics and *auto-applies* the broadly-useful ones as skills through the structural gate (hybrid store — role-local memory + skills) |
| Optional `/dream` | If a reflection/`dream` skill is installed, delegate the distillation step to it for a deeper retrospective; otherwise distill inline. Experience Capture does not depend on `/dream`. |

## A note on these guidelines

This is a **projection, not a formal protocol** — heuristics the agent applies with judgment, the same footing as [Delegation for Focus](delegation.md) and [Interview Mode](interview-mode.md). A spurious checkpoint costs one cheap summary, not corruption; a missed semantic shift is caught at the next structural boundary; an over-eager cadence is flagged by audit. Don't encode rigid MUST/NEVER machinery beyond the two that are load-bearing — *factual-only trailers* and *harvest-before-demote* — and keep the rest as prose.
